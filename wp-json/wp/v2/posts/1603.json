The CopySense Appliance accurately and affordably identifies traffic of unauthorized copyrighted works without disrupting legitimate peer-to-peer (P2P) activities. Version 4.0 of the software offers three major upgrades for the academic marketplace: it uniquely protects against the downloading of electronic textbooks; it provides a university with automated graduated responses for network use violations; and it expands support of large university networks.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have designed this new version of our software in specific response to recent feedback from our university customers who see the need to expand features to best support their environments,&#8221; said Vance Ikezoye, president and CEO of Audible Magic. &#8220;Their goal coincides with ours &#8220;together we hope to build better \u2018digital citizens\u2019 among our student populations so as they move from university campuses to the workplace and beyond, they will bring with them a strong sense of ethics towards network usage.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For the first time, universities can identify unauthorized electronic textbook downloads across their networks. The appliance provides a new layer of protection for university bookstores, textbook publishers and professor-authors against this activity on their own networks.<\/p>\n<p>CopySense version 4.0 now includes a graduated response system that enables universities to cost-effectively educate its student populations with regard to copyright infringement. Many universities have instituted a three-strikes approach to network-use policy violations, seizing the opportunity to educate their students about responsible P2P usage. Their goal is two-fold &#8212; stop illegal file sharing activities and leverage the teachable moment so as to communicate network use policies and build good \u201cdigital citizens.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Graduated Response System, which was previously sold as an add-on feature and is now included in the base product release, automatically administers staged messages depending on the number of times a student has been caught illegally file sharing. Because detection and response are automated and integrated with the campus judicial system, administrators are not consumed with trying to manage each student infraction.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, CopySense Appliance version 4.0 includes expanded support for the large, complex networks found on university and college campuses. The new multi-module feature synchronizes student infractions and infraction level in the Graduated Response System among multiple appliances. It increases the overall effectiveness of the Graduated Response System.<\/p>\n<p>To date, over 70 institutions have found the CopySense Appliance to be a highly accurate and affordable solution in administering their network use policies and in taking advantage of the teachable moments around illegal file sharing. Audible Magic\u2019s CopySense Appliance provides intelligent control over P2P usage across networks. It is the only solution that can identify illegal sharing of copyrighted work without disruption to other legitimate P2P uses. The plug-and-play CopySense Appliance connects easily to any network and is simple to manage.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<p>Audible Magic Corporation provides content management services to the media and entertainment industries as well as business, governmental, and educational institutions.
