With a new add-on module, the CopySense Appliance not only filters the illegal sharing of copyrighted media files but also can now help universities enforce network policies by replacing manual processes.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve spent years working closely with educational institutions and helping them find peace between students and the entertainment industry,\u201d said Audible Magic CEO Vance Ikezoye. \u201cFurthering the mission of education is our goal with these new features.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The new Education and Administration Module, available for both existing and new installations of the CopySense Appliance, allows campuses to determine their own network use policies and easily select from a range of actions in response to violation attempts. \u201cSome campuses just want to curtail illegal file trading,\u201d said Ikezoye, \u201cwhile others want to restrict all P2P activity.\u201d In either case, the CopySense Appliance allows the institution to choose what constitutes a network use violation, what the significance of each violation is, and how many violations trigger some kind of automatic action toward the user.<\/p>\n<p>Automatic actions taken by the CopySense Appliance can include redirecting the user\u2019s web browser and\/or restricting the user\u2019s network access. In one possible scenario, when a user attempts to use a P2P application to illegally download a copyrighted song or movie, a notification could be automatically sent and the user classified as a first offender. Upon a 2nd offense, P2P and web access bandwidth could be reduced significantly, and the user could be required to complete a self-paced education module on the law and value of copyrights. The 3rd offense could block all network use for 48 hours. The 4th offense could block all network use and require the user to meet with a designated advisor before restoring access. Many other scenarios are possible, matching a wide range of institutional policies and enforcement procedures.<\/p>\n<p>Selectable network violations range from attempting to exchange copyrighted music, video or software files to attempting to exchange files containing sexual content including child pornography. Violations can also extend to attempts to access web sites containing known malicious content or child pornography. Some institutions may choose to prohibit all P2P access and\/or prohibit access to problem web sites.<\/p>\n<p>Ikezoye remarked, \u201cInstitutions have been telling us they not only want to prohibit illegal network traffic, but they also want to gently educate and motivate students toward appropriate network use. In any of these scenarios, the institution can choose to keep user identities anonymous and just let the CopySense Appliance do the work without collecting user information.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>More About The CopySense\u00ae Network Appliance<\/h4>\n<p>The CopySense Appliance is widely installed in public and private educational institutions across the US. The product is best known for its ability to filter out P2P transactions containing illegal file trades in a manner very similar to the way virus filters operate.<\/p>\n<p>Artists and publishers desiring to protect their copyrighted works register in Audible Magic\u2019s continually updated database. The media \u2018fingerprints\u2019 in that database are then matched against file trades attempted on networks where the CopySense Appliance is installed. Offending file trades are blocked while legitimate file sharing is left untouched. The filtering capabilities of the CopySense Appliance also expand to the selective blocking of malicious content, including child pornography, on both P2P networks and web sites.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about the CopySense Appliance and solutions available to education, visit<a href=\"https:\/\/www.audiblemagic.com\/solutions\/education.asp\">www.audiblemagic.com\/education<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<p>Audible Magic Corporation is the leading provider of content management and anti-piracy services.
