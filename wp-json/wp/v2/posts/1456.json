Sony Music material will also be registered with RepliCheck, a database of &#8220;audio fingerprints&#8221; that CD pressing plants can utilize in order to avoid pirate activity. This registration will also allow Sony Music material to be tracked by Audible Magic\u2019s broadcast monitoring services, which provide royalty information used by SESAC, and marketing information used by CMJ Network for its RAM (Realtime Airplay Metrics) airplay reporting service.<\/p>\n<p>Sony Music and Audible Magic will also work together to support the Campus Action Network (CAN), an industry-wide initiative that provides colleges and universities with recommendations on new technology solutions, including filtering systems, that help combat illegal file-sharing more effectively while preserving other legitimate uses of P2P services. CAN also helps universities across the country to identify the legitimate online music services that work best for them, and to educate their student bodies on copyright issues related to peer-to-peer file sharing.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Sony Music will license Audible Magic software libraries and integrate them into their custom-built global digital asset management system. The Audible magic fingerprinting software, which is based upon its CopySense technology, will enable Sony Music to streamline content management in their database of hundreds of thousands of songs across international regions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are looking forward to working with Sony Music on a broad range of technology issues associated with their business\u201d said Vance Ikezoye, CEO of Audible Magic. \u201cWe believe our products and technologies support their vision and we are enthusiastic about the prospect of working with Sony on issues that are so vital to the new media industry.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Philip R. Wiser, Chief Technology Officer, Sony Music Entertainment, commented, \u201cAudible Magic\u2019s pioneering work in the area of content identification, tracking, and protection has earned them a well-deserved reputation for excellence, and we are delighted to be working with them on a wide range of innovative initiatives including our CAN and P2P filtering programs.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<p>Sony Music Entertainment Inc.
