(Nasdaq NM: LOUD), a leading provider of Webcasting and digital media streaming services, and Audible Magic Corporation, a provider of content-based identification (CBID) technologies, today announced at the Future of Music Conference in Washington D.C., the immediate availability of a digital music tracking and management solution.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Loudeye is contributing major portions of its extensive digital music archive system and metadata database, which includes content from both major and independent labels, its scalable and extensible media data center and its robust hosting and network infrastructure. These are integrated in a solution that includes Audible Magic\u2019s advanced CBID technologies for accurately identifying and tracking music or speech from digital sources such as files and Internet streams, as well as analog sources such as terrestrial radio and TV broadcasts, without the use of watermarks.<\/p>\n<h4>The Challenge<\/h4>\n<p>The music industry is undergoing a period of dynamic change. Industry trends demonstrate that consumers are beginning to expect flexible access to their music in a variety of digital formats and on a variety of device platforms. To meet this demand, vendors are proliferating, spurring new distribution and licensing models. Nonetheless, new consumption behaviors, business models and distribution opportunities require the need for copyright holders and artists to be paid for the usage of their music. Lack of standards, incompatible systems, inaccurate song information, the cost and complexity of in-house deployments, and the sheer volume of music transactions that need to be managed make this a challenging problem.<\/p>\n<h4>The Solution<\/h4>\n<p>The solution that Loudeye and Audible Magic are announcing today represents a back-end system that meets the specialized needs of music service providers, content owners and global rights organizations to address these challenges.<\/p>\n<p>The two companies provide an end-to-end solution that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>independently monitors and generates accurate reports of digital music usage and performances;<\/li>\n<li>functions across multiple devices, platforms and networks;<\/li>\n<li>easily integrates into existing systems;<\/li>\n<li>scales to handle the high volumes of consumer music usage across all broadcast, peer-to-peer and subscription service models; and<\/li>\n<li>provides cost savings of 20-40% when compared to the use of multiple point technologies and in-house developed solutions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cThis joint offering represents an important step in providing a comprehensive system that we believe addresses many of the challenges faced by the music industry in developing a viable market for authorized usage of digital music,\u201d said John T. Baker, Loudeye chairman and chief executive officer. \u201cThis solution is capable of non-intrusively and accurately identifying a wide range of audio content and provides the industry with critical and much-needed media services.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>How it Works<\/h4>\n<p>The initial implementation utilizes major portions of Loudeye\u2019s music information database to generate a digital fingerprint library using Audible Magic\u2019s audio identification technology. The fingerprint library is integrated with Loudeye\u2019s track-level metadata to create the industry\u2019s most comprehensive reference database for music identification. Audible Magic\u2019s CBID technologies monitor digital music usage and performances, comparing such activity against the reference database to accurately identify each song to a master recording, copyright owner and artist.<\/p>\n<p>Audible Magic will receive database updates on a continuous basis as new song information is added to Loudeye\u2019s catalogue, and officials from both companies anticipate it will rapidly expand to include Loudeye\u2019s complete music information database, which spans nearly the entire North American music catalog.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur comprehensive music identification technology, combined with Loudeye\u2019s extensive metadata, enables us to offer the media industry trusted and practical solutions for digital content tracking and management,\u201d said Vance Ikezoye, president and CEO of Audible Magic. \u201cThis solution can be deployed immediately to help copyright holders and artists benefit from the growth in use of digital music.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Pricing and Availability<\/h4>\n<p>The combined solution is available immediately.
