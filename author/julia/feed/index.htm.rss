The </span><span data-contrast="auto">COVID-19 </span><span data-contrast="auto">pandemic has affected governments worldwide, </span><span data-contrast="auto">including the member states of the European Union, as they shift their focus from day-to-day legislation to battling the outbreak.

Because of the coronavirus crisis, I think not so many people are thinking about copyright&#8221;. The crisis has also impacted the stakeholder dialogues, which will help </span><span data-contrast="auto">define guidelines for implementation of the Directive across the EU. The seventh </span><span data-contrast="auto">meeting was scheduled for </span><span data-contrast="auto">March 30th but</span><span data-contrast="auto"> was postponed by the European Commission due to the crisis.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The article </span><span data-contrast="auto">also </span><span data-contrast="auto">examines whether a </span><span data-contrast="auto">live</span><span data-contrast="auto"> streaming service can be considered an Online Content-Sharing Service Provider (OCSSP). Article 2(6) of The Copyright Directive defines an OCSSP as an online service, one of whose main purposes is “to </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">store</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> and give the public access” to large amounts of copyright content which it “organizes and promotes for profit-making purposes.” </span><span data-contrast="auto">The </span><span data-contrast="auto">issue is whether the ephemeral nature of the storage disqualifies the live streaming platform from being classified as an OCSSP. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Rosati examines this question in-depth in the context of the Copyright Directive and the E-Commerce Directive and concludes: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">“Live streaming providers that behave like Streaming Platform X in the example above are to be regarded as OCSSPs, even if the storage made of user-uploaded content is limited in time.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Dr Rosati concludes that the activities of the live streaming platforms are therefore governed by Article 17(4) of the Copyright Directive,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and because of that,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">OCSSPs</span><span data-contrast="auto"> can protect themselves from liability</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> if they make efforts to obtain licenses for the content, and in the absence of any license, use best efforts, according to high industry standards, to prevent the availability of unlicensed content contained in the live streams.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> In </span><span data-contrast="auto">conclusion</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">if </span><span data-contrast="auto">live streaming platforms are </span><span data-contrast="auto">classified as OCSSP</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto">, the new Copyright Directive provides them a new ‘safe-harbour’ from liability provided they meet their other Article 17 obligations.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p>December 16, 2019</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>My name is<a href="https://www.audiblemagic.com/company/leadership/"> Vance Ikezoye</a>. I am co-founder and CEO of Audible Magic. With me is Mike Edwards, General Manager and Vice President for the EMEA region. We would like to thank the Commission for this opportunity to speak.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this presentation, we would like permission to use the term “Platform” to represent the Online Content-Sharing Service Providers (OCSSP).</p>
<p>Audible Magic is a technology company that was founded in 1999. Over the past decade, we have been one of the leading providers of copyright identification services to these platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Business Roles and Policies</strong></p>
<p>I would like to share an overview of how we work with Platforms and the Content Industry. Our customer, the party that pays for our services, are the Platforms. The Rightsholders have and must take affirmative action to register their repertoire into our systems. We do not charge Rightsholders for works registration.</p>
<p>Usage and match data are confidential information of the Platform. Any release of that information requires explicit approval by the Platforms. However, our current agreements generally allow us to provide limited information to Rightsholders about the services used by each Platform.</p>
<p>Since the Platforms pay, they have discretion as to what services they use and what content they process.</p>
<p>This arrangement has been working well in practice for over a decade. We believe that most of our customers and rightsholders act in good faith and are trying to do the right thing for all involved, including the consumer.</p>
<p><strong>The Technology</strong></p>
<p>Our service uses a fingerprinting technology which we have developed and continue to enhance. A fingerprinting technology matches content based upon perceptual characteristics of the content itself. It doesn’t rely on metadata or embedded marks. The technology can differentiate between live and studio versions of the same song. We provide services for identifying music and film/video content.</p>
<p>Audible Magic’s scientists were among the early pioneers of audio fingerprinting and obtained many of the first patents in the field. We continue to invest and enhance the technology to keep up with the rapid changes in digital media. We have also been granted an extensive portfolio of patents which provides our customers peace of mind from any threat of litigation for patent infringement. Uniquely, we indemnify our customers against any claims for patent infringement arising from the use of our technology.</p>
<p><strong>Works Registration</strong></p>
<p>We have over 140,000 rightsholders’ content registered in our program across music and film/video. We receive on average 300,000 new works per month. This content comes from over 140 countries. We have a range of rightsholders from major record labels and Hollywood studios with millions of works, to independent singer/songwriters with five tracks. There are no restrictions. Any bona fide copyright owner may register their works with Audible Magic. Most of these registrations are provided to us prior to commercial release or broadcast.</p>
<p>The Registration Process is very straightforward. Rightsholders contact AM; many times they are referred to us by our platform customers. They first sign a simple 2-page registration agreement. We do not charge rightsholders for registration of their works.</p>
<p>Rightsholders then either provide digital or physical copies of their works or we provide them tools to fingerprint the content themselves. They provide us basic information about each copyrighted work, including song titles, artist names, record labels, show titles, season and episode numbers. In addition, for each title, they supply us their designated business rule, such as allow, block, or monetize. We can also support duration-based rules, which for example can enable content under a specified duration to be allowed.</p>
<p>We can manage these rules by Platform. Thus, the same work could be blocked at one platform and allowed for use on another. We ingest the fingerprints, metadata, and business rules into our services. This metadata provides the basis for the information communicated to the Platform when a match occurs. This information is then ingested into our identification system.</p>
<p>Many right holders use third party service providers to register their content with Audible Magic and with other service providers. We strongly support moves by organizations such as ALPA to set up a one-stop-shops to enable their members to effortlessly register with multiple content recognition services including Audible Magic, Facebook, YouTube ContentID and INA.</p>
<p><strong>The Identification Service for Platforms</strong></p>
<p>We work with Platforms to implement our service. Platforms deploy a simple piece of software at the point of ingest after upload by the consumer. This integration is very easy, and the programming required is measured in minutes or hours (at most). This software processes the unknown media and generates the data needed to identify the work. This data is sent to our services via the internet. There is no information about the consumer that is used or transmitted to us. Each identification request is processed in less than a second and the service returns the metadata and business rules associated with the matched work back to the Platform.</p>
<p>There are various configurations of the identification technology which are optimized for each platform and their specific use case. We try to balance the thoroughness of the analysis against the cost of the service. In general, the current technology standards that our customers utilize is the unknown content contains 20 contiguous seconds matched to the registered copyrighted content for longer form content, and 5-10 contiguous seconds for short form content.</p>
<p>Every month we process over 3-billion identification requests per month from our customers. At peak, we can process over 8,000 requests per second. These volumes demonstrate the scale of user generated content on social video platforms.</p>
<p>With regards to Staydown capabilities, we have been providing that service since 2008, however most of our Customers have not implemented this feature.</p>
<p>Our customers are diverse. Platforms take the form of websites and mobile applications. Our customers range from some of the largest platforms in the world to small platforms in Africa and Southeast Asia. We have platforms that handle hundreds of files a month and platforms that do thousands per second.</p>
<p>The customers range in technical capabilities. We have small platforms with the CEO acting as the software programmer to major platforms with teams of engineers and lawyers. We have platforms that utilize the ad-support monetization model and those that are subscription-based. As a general rule, most of our platforms do not broadly monetize their UGC videos.</p>
<p><strong>Legitimate Technical Issues</strong></p>
<p>In the course of these Commission Dialogue meetings, there have been a number of issues discussed by the various Stakeholders. Many of these issues are legitimate and worthy of continued discussion. We’d like to briefly comment on some of them:</p>
<p><strong>False Positives and Over-Blocking</strong></p>
<p>The use of an identification technology is the only practical method of dealing with the volume of user content being generated. Since this is an automated process, accuracy is perhaps one of the most important requirements for an identification technology. All technologies are not alike. My co-founder used to say that it is very easy to invent a bad technology. And the reality is that technologies can be optimized for one attribute at the expense of others.</p>
<p>We believe that incorrectly identifying a work, a false positive, is a critical error and therefore ensuring misidentifications are essentially zero is the single most important objective for a production technology. We believe false identifications lead to over-blocking, attributing rights to the wrong content, or platforms having to manually review results.</p>
<p>One example of where false positive problems can occur is with measuring too short a duration of content. Trying to use fingerprinting technology to match one or two seconds of audio is like trying to match two compositions based upon two musical notes.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright Exceptions</strong></p>
<p>Copyright exceptions require a high degree of intellectual judgement and an understanding and appreciation of context. We do not represent that any technology can solve this problem in an automated fashion. Ultimately, these types of determinations must be handled by human judgement. However, identification technologies can supply data which can be used to enable more informed copyright exception analysis.</p>
<p>We fully support the call by many of the organizations representing consumer rights for transparent, accessible, and speedy appeal processes, administered by humans as the optimum way of addressing the issue. We also want to recognize that several of our customers have described in their presentations during these proceedings their redress mechanisms. It is probably because of these redress mechanisms that, in the more than 12 years we have been providing content recognition services to some of the world’s largest platforms, that we have not become aware of any serious or systematic issues in this area.</p>
<p><strong>High Industry Standards</strong></p>
<p>There has been much discussion with respect to the High Industry Standards language of the Directive. We believe that a copyright identification service which meets this bar must have at least the following attributes: First, service must be representative of global content. The service must be accessible and supported by a critical mass of rightholders, who have affirmatively registered their content. And it must be a turnkey and affordable solution for the range of platforms. We believe there are a number of commercially available content recognition services for the music and film/video industries that meet these criteria. Although this is a difficult issue, the drafting of the Directive was very thoughtful with respect to the recognition of the ongoing evolution in media and continuing improvement of technology to identify it.</p>
<p><strong>Complexity of Licensing Administration</strong></p>
<p>The clear intention of the Commission with the Directive is to encourage licensing of content by the Platforms. The reality is that there are complexities related to both the licensing of content as well as the administration of the licenses and royalties. These complexities cause issues of time and expense for both platforms and the rightsholders. The problem logistically is how to manage the sheer number of rightsholders and size of catalogs that exist globally. And an added comment, roughly 90% of the titles registered with us never get identified, even once out of the 3 billion identifications we perform every month, across our platform customers.</p>
<p><strong>Red Herrings</strong></p>
<p>On the other side of these proceedings, there are some issues that continue to be raised as concerns related to the use of identification technologies. These concerns I would characterize as “Red Herrings”.</p>
<p><strong>Cost of the Service</strong></p>
<p>The first Red Herring I would like to mention is the cost of the service. Our service fees are based upon the number of files processed. So smaller platforms with fewer files, pay less than large platforms. We have customers that pay a few hundred Euros per month. In addition, there is an active and competitive market for content identification services, and there is no need for any platform to make the capital investment to develop their own technology. Some of the biggest and smallest platforms in the market are customers of ours.</p>
<p><strong>Cost and Difficulty of Implementation</strong></p>
<p>Another frequently heard Red Herring is the issue that the technical implementation of identification services is time consuming and difficult. We have had customers implement our technology in minutes based only upon our documentation. We also make available technical support to our customers, to help them implement our solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Maturity</strong></p>
<p>We believe that the technology for identification is mature and presents a viable solution to all sizes and types of Platforms. We believe this because our customers prove it. Our services have been used by scores of platforms reliably and non-controversially for over a decade.</p>
<p><strong>Future Directions</strong></p>
<p>With that said, there are areas the tech industry can help both platforms and rightsholders in implementing both the letter and intention of the new Directive. One of the biggest areas, which we cited previously as an issue, is in licensing and royalty administration.</p>
<p>We believe that the content licensing effort for both the platforms and rightsholders is very complex and time consuming. Because platforms are global and rights are by territory, licensing for a platform is a non-trivial exercise.</p>
<p>Secondly, once licenses have been obtained, the effort to administer and report on usage and royalties is very difficult for the platforms. And on the other side, the rightsholders have an equally challenging and difficult time processing and understanding the reports provided by the platforms.</p>
<p>We think this is an area where the technology vendors, such as Audible Magic, can provide further value to supporting the goals of the Commission with Article 17 – which is to enable a more frictionless environment for licensing and use of copyrighted content by consumers and platforms.</p>
<p>I can report that we are collaborating with many music right holders and platforms to develop simple, one-stop licensing processes, and to develop the tools for license management and administration that will remove the need for individual platforms to invest in building these systems themselves. We will be making further announcements in this regard as these systems are launched.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><strong>As EU Member States Move to the Transposition of Article 17, EU Commission Holds the First of Several Stakeholder Dialogues</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>The October 15th Meeting</strong></h4>
<p>The Commission has set up a series of required stakeholder dialogues to explore best practices for cooperation between the online content sharing service providers (OCSSPs) and the rightsholders.</p>
<p><strong>Guidance for Implementation</strong></p>
<p>The input provided by attendees will help the Commission create a document to be published later next year that will provide guidance to member states regarding the implementation of Article 17.</p>
<p>The first stakeholder meeting on October 15 was focused on the OCSSPs, and the music rightsholders, as well as consumer rights organizations. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Vimeo and Soundcloud provided the OCSSP perspective. Representatives for record labels, Copyright Management Organizations and music publishers included IFPI, GEMA, ICMP to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>Generally, the rightsholders addressed the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Transparency and regularity of reporting of usage.</li>
<li>Wider access for all right holders to rights management tools like YouTube’s Content ID.</li>
<li>Consistent support of take down/stay down from the platforms.</li>
<li>Several rightsholders stated that the platforms should use Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) software, which they described as affordable and highly accurate.</li>
<li>Songwriter representatives called for the deployment of technology that recognized compositions in addition to sound recordings</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The OCSSPs covered a variety of areas including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The policies and procedures that they have in place regarding the usage of copyrighted works, often referring to DMCA.</li>
<li>Although many of the OCSSPs have licensing agreements with major rightsholders, several wanted more guidance regarding what entails best efforts to obtain licensing deals required by Article 17.</li>
<li>Several platforms spoke about their usage of Automatic Content Recognition technology.</li>
<li>Representatives of the startup community voiced their concerns about the practical implementation of the provisions for startups:</li>
<li>The lack of expertise and funds needed to negotiate licensing deals with large rightsholders.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consumer organizations</strong> warned that over-blocking could suppress free speech and highlighted the potential issues of false positives and blocking of uploads subject to copyright exceptions. They stressed the need for OCSSPs to implement transparent and speedy appeal processes for users, and to encourage their use.</p>
<p>Both sides reiterated that the cooperation regarding the usage of copyrighted material would benefit the platforms, artists, and users. In addition, each party wanted to encourage licensing and minimize over-blocking.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Automated Content Recognition, or ACR, has become an integral part of the consumption of music and video as we experience them today. As more platforms publish user generated content, effectively monitoring use of copyrighted material has become increasingly difficult. So, how does one choose an ACR vendor that can be relied on?</p>



<p>_____________________________</p>



<p><em>Guest post by <strong><a href="https://www.audiblemagic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audible Magic</a> </strong>VP of Product Development and Marketing, <strong>Jay Friedman</strong> on <a href="https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2019/06/6-things-you-must-ask-your-acr-vendor-.html">Hypebot.com</a></em></p>



<p>Automated Content Recognition (ACR) is essential to music and video consumption as we know it today. </p>



<p>An important aspect for companies distributing content with music and video is the aspect of digital media rights. With the explosion of user generated content, it has become increasingly difficult to monitor and manage the proper use of copyrighted material. </p>



<p>Platforms distributing user generated content typically come from a purely technological background and can easily overlook important aspects of digital media rights. This oversight can cripple a business either via an infringement lawsuit or shortage of capital, especially since content platforms vary widely from large technology providers to popular apps to yet undeveloped offerings. </p>



<p>As an example, the European Union recently approved <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18280726/europe-copyright-directive"><em>Article 17</em></a> requiring companies who host user generated content and have a European presence or customer base to take responsibility to either license works or prevent usage of unlicensed user-uploaded copyrighted material. If a user uploads a piece of content that infringes copyright, the platform is at risk. According to Article 17, platforms must filter users’ uploaded content for copyright materials or have a license for it. </p>



<p>What’s an online platform to do? Finding a vendor for ACR is a vital business activity for those who are subjected to dealing with digital media rights. This technology puts in place a method for platforms to protect copyrighted content from being improperly used. But with several to choose from, what is the criteria to look for? How does one determine which vendor is appropriate for their business? How can one ensure that the services provided are cost-effective and necessary? Here are six things to look for (or even ask directly) when making a determination. </p>



<p><strong>What is the pedigree of the technology? </strong></p>



<p>ACR is a technology service, so it only makes sense to start the hunt for a vendor by exploring the merits of the technology itself. Ask if the vendor holds patents which the ACR is built upon, or if the technology is licensed from another company. The answer will give you a clue if the vendor will be capable of addressing emerging market challenges in stride. A strong R&amp;D department is a great indicator of a vendor that seeks to push the industry forward. </p>



<p><strong>Does the service scale well? </strong></p>



<p>Does your company need to monitor the usage of a handful of digital media rights, or do you have to cover just about everything under the sun? Several pop-up ACR vendors have appeared recently to address the former, sometimes licensing technology or developing a service that satisfies one specific task needed. These pop-ups are worth investigating if your needs are truly specific and limited in scope, but take caution to ensure that they’ll be able to handle an increased workload as your service demands grow and – more vitally – the amount of content that needs to be scanned or monitored increases. </p>



<p><strong>What is the technology’s false positive rate? </strong></p>



<p>Take heed of the false positive rate, the fine print statistic that cuts through any misleading marketing metrics. If a vendor boasts scalability as a primary value proposition, asking about false positive rate is the follow-up question that will help you find out if service quality was sacrificed in order to achieve scale. A false positive rate of even 0.5% means that for every 1,000 pieces of digital media scanned, five will be mistakenly given an incorrect attribution of ownership. The effect that this has on user experience cannot be understated. A spotty experience easily translates to the loss of users or customers.  </p>



<p><strong>Who are the customers? </strong></p>



<p>This segues neatly into the next question. The music industry is chalk full of long-standing partner relationships. Top labels are going to work with vendors they trust to protect their catalogs, and will be hard-pressed to change from companies they trust to do the job right.  On the flip side, UGC platforms want to ensure they are in full compliance for rights usage and desire a vendor that understands international nuances – that their vendor has they’re backs.  Entertainment may be “fun” to the everyday citizen that consumes media, but in the business world the emphasis is on the bottom line and sound practices. If you recognize a vendor’s customers as major players, that’s a good indicator that the vendor has an established cadence of trust. </p>



<p><strong>What will this cost? </strong></p>



<p>ACR is the technology that the digital media rights ecosystem can’t afford to not have. That said, what good is an ACR vendor if a company can’t afford the service in the first place? Vendors shouldn’t offer a one-size-fits-all solution at a single premium price; rather, cost should reflect the level of service that is being provided. After all, distributors and platforms have varying policies and needs when it comes to identification reporting. Some companies seek basic identification, while others desire advanced reporting and other features. Know what your needs are before you shop, or find a vendor that will help you determine what’s right for you based on your business model and policies. </p>



<p><strong>Will the vendor find ways to open new revenue streams? </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e20240a464dfa8200c-popup"><img src="https://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e20240a464dfa8200c-320wi" alt="5" /></a></figure>



<p>This question falls outside the normal line of thinking for basic software-focused ACR vendors, which makes it a hardnose test of business smarts. Those who know how the digital media rights landscape works will be able to work collaboratively with you to suggest and enable new revenue streams. Not only should a vendor have a line of questioning to understand your business model and connect the dots, they should be actively engaged in trying to improve your company. This doesn’t fall outside of the realm of what should be expected from a vendor, because savvy ones know that your success ultimately becomes their success. This line of thinking makes an ACR vendor a valuable asset as an advisor. Keep in mind there’s no substitute for management that has been there, done that, and can draw from the industry to help you succeed. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Amidst news of unreleased music impersonators, partnership ensures protection of artist’s original content on music streaming services and social platforms</h2>
<p><strong>June 12, 2019 (LOS GATOS, Calif.) – </strong><a href="https://www.audiblemagic.com/">Audible Magic</a>, music’s industry standard for content identification linked to digital rights, announced a strategic partnership with leading music distribution service <a href="https://distrokid.com/">DistroKid</a> to combat the rising trend of “fraudulent artists” stealing and uploading unreleased original content. The move will help protect artists worldwide by verifying the authenticity of both tracks and artists that the music originated from <em>before</em> music is distributed to streaming services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When an artist requests to upload song files via DistroKid, Audible Magic’s RightsRx<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> solution checks its comprehensive registry of over 20 million media assets to ensure the artist-uploaded content is conflict-free before distribution to streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube and more. In its ongoing effort to promote artist authenticity, DistroKid will also be the first distributor to implement Audible Magic’s cutting-edge detection tool, Broad Spectrum. An extension of Audible Magic’s content identification service, Broad Spectrum can uniquely identify extreme manipulations of rate, pitch and tempo using only small clips of audio.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In this day and age, it’s imperative for artists everywhere to register their content to not only claim ownership, avoiding impersonators, but to also ensure that they are being accurately credited and compensated,” said Vance Ikezoye, president and chief executive officer at Audible Magic. “DistroKid has a positive reputation amongst artists for making distribution fast, reliable and easy. This partnership signals our joint commitment to an industry working towards clean data, proper rights management and improved artist attribution.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, in response to the increase in fake artists attempts to steal and distribute unreleased music, DistroKid is announcing a new and free service called DistroLock (<a href="https://distrolock.com/">https://distrolock.com</a>). Launching today, DistroLock allows any musical artist to upload and register their unreleased audio files through the platform, which will encode a unique audio fingerprint and add it to Audible Magic’s registry. DistroKid developed this platform with Audible Magic’s insights as an industry-wide solution that will request to block the unauthorized release of an artist’s music (or “leaks”) from appearing on streaming services and social platforms. DistroLock also includes an API that will allow other distributors and streaming services to easily validate the authenticity of music uploaded to their respective platforms <em>before</em> making it available to the public.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Until now, there hasn’t been a definitive way for artists to say, ‘this is my audio, don’t let anyone else release it,’” said DistroKid chief executive officer Philip Kaplan. “With the launch of DistroLock, any musician can preemptively register their</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>audio to help ensure that unauthorized releases don’t see the light of day. This partnership with Audible Magic and the creation of DistroLock will help artists by ensuring that their original content is uploaded and distributed fairly, with accuracy and speed.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Audible Magic Offers New Services </strong><strong>to Manage Distribution Conflicts</strong></p>



<p> In 2018, the top digital service providers (DSPs) publicized their preferred distribution partners and their ranking criteria. For Apple, whose ranking criteria includes exceptional content review&#8221; and &#8220;low rejection rate,&#8221; CD Baby and The Orchard made the &#8220;Preferred Plus&#8221; list. For Spotify, whose criteria lists &#8220;preventing infringement content,&#8221; The Orchard made the &#8220;Preferred&#8221; list while CD Baby made the various &#8220;Recommended&#8221; partner lists.</p>

<p>The challenge of adhering to these strict DSP guidelines while the keeping pace with the huge growth in the space is daunting for digital distributors. Digital distributors must manage current catalogs and ingest large numbers of tracks every day in an efficient and cost-effective way. Buzz Angle Music’s 2018 report on U.S. music consumption indicated that the number of unique titles audio-streamed was 36.3M tracks, a 9.2% increase over 2017.  The sheer number of tracks eliminates manual review and metadata checks prove to be unreliable.</p>



<p>As a result, digital distributors use automated content recognition (ACR) technologies to scan new releases, as well as their back catalog, to ensure they can meet these strict content review requirements. A distributor can improve their overall score and ranking if they can deliver a clean catalog that doesn’t create a lot of copyright ownership conflicts at a DSP. The impact on their business is significant. For example, as an Apple Music Preferred Plus distributor a company will have access to support for advanced customer features and analytics as well as early access to product features.</p>
